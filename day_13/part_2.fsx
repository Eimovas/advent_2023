    So... when I smudge something, like in the sample:
    1 ..##..##. 1
    2 ..#.##.#. 2
    3v##......#v3
    4^##......#^4
    5 ..#.##.#. 5
    6 ..##..##. 6
    7 #.#.##.#. 7
    
    Why did they choose rows 3&4 instead of cols 5&6? Like the same old one? It says in description that
    "The old reflection line won't necessarily continue being valid after the smudge is fixed", but it is still valid
    in this case. Am I mean to always chose a different line then? Seems to contradict the task.
    
    Or the second sample:
    1v#...##..#v1
    2^#...##..#^2
    3 ..##..### 3
    4 #####.##. 4
    5 #####.##. 5
    6 ..##..### 6
    7 #....#..# 7
    
    Why did they choose a new line then again? The old one, which was 4&5 is still valid.
    I clearly misunderstood everything.
